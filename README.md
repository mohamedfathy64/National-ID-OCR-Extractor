# Egyptian-National-ID-OCR-Extractor
Python script to extract Egyptian National ID (14-digit) using Gemini's Vision API and converting Arabic numerals.
🇪🇬 National ID OCR Extractor

This Python script uses the Gemini API for multimodal analysis and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the 14-digit Egyptian National ID number from an image.

It automatically handles the conversion from Eastern Arabic numerals (like ٣٠٤٠٨١٢١١٨٧١) found on the ID card to standard Western Arabic numerals (304081211871), providing a clean, usable string.

⚙️ Prerequisites

Python 3 installed on your system.

requests library: This is used for making API calls.

pip install requests


A Gemini API Key: You must obtain a personal API key for free from the Google AI  ([https://studio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)) Studio API Key Page.

🔑 Security Setup (CRITICAL)

Never hardcode your API key in the source code. To run this script securely, you must set your Gemini API Key as an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY.

Operating System
